------------------------------------------

*Approach*
---------------
Using ```GROUP BY```, we can simply group all the rows having the same ```player_id``` and then find the one with the minimum ```event_date```

*Code*
--------------
```
SELECT player_id, MIN(event_date) AS first_login FROM 
Activity
GROUP BY player_id;
```
