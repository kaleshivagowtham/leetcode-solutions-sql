*619. Biggest Single Number*
------------------------------------------

*Approach*
---------------
In the SubQuery, find all the elements that are unique in the table.
Then find the max of them, in the MainQuery.
We could also do it without using SubQuery.
**Note**-> The reason we are using SubQuery here is because, ***SubQueries always return null instead of emptyness***

*Code*
--------------
```
SELECT max(num) AS num FROM MyNumbers
WHERE num IN
    (
        SELECT num FROM MyNumbers
        GROUP BY num
        HAVING COUNT(num) = 1
    ) ;
```
