*596. Classes More Than 5 Students*
------------------------------------------

*Approach*
---------------
Count the number of same class in the table, and then see if it is atleast 5.
We are using HAVING claiuse here, as WHERE clause can't be used with GROUP BY.

*Code*
--------------
```
SELECT class FROM Courses
GROUP BY class
HAVING COUNT(class) >= 5;
```
