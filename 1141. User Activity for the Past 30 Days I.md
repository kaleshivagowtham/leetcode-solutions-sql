*1141. User Activity for the Past 30 Days I*
------------------------------------------

*Approach*
---------------
Simply count the distinct user_id(s) that were active betweer ```2019-06-27``` and ```2019-07-27```(as 30 days is mentioned in the question) and ```GROUP BY``` them by the ```activity_date```.

*Code*
--------------
```
SELECT activity_date AS day, COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS active_users
FROM Activity
WHERE activity_date > '2019-06-27' AND activity_date <= '2019-07-27'
GROUP BY activity_date;
```
