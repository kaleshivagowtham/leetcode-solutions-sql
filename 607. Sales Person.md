*607. Sales Person*
------------------------------------------

*Approach*
---------------
Lets find all the salesmen who are related to 'RED' company first.
Then we can print all the ones, who have nothing to do with the company.

*Code*
--------------
```
SELECT s.name FROM salesPerson s
WHERE s.name NOT IN
( 
  SELECT s.name FROM
  SalesPerson s 
  CROSS JOIN Orders o
  ON s.sales_id = o.sales_id
  CROSS JOIN Company c
  ON o.com_id = c.com_id
  WHERE c.name = "RED"
);
```
