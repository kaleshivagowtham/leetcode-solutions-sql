*586. Customer Placing the Largest Number of Orders*
------------------------------------------

*Approach*
---------------
Create a table (in subquery) which is sorted in descending order of number of products ordered by each id.
And then in the main query, return the 1st row.

*Code*
--------------
```
SELECT customer_number FROM 
  (
    SELECT customer_number, COUNT(customer_number) AS customer_num FROM Orders
    GROUP BY customer_number
    ORDER BY customer_num DESC
  ) AS CUST_TABLE
LIMIT 1;
```
