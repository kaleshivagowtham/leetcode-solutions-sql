*1075. Project Employees I*
------------------------------------------

*Approach*
---------------
Simply Join the 2 tables, and group them by the employee_id s of both the tables.
Use ```ROUND``` to round the values upto 2 digits.

*Code*
--------------
```
SELECT p.project_id, ROUND(AVG(e.experience_years),2) AS average_years
FROM Project p LEFT JOIN Employee e
ON p.employee_id = e.employee_id
GROUP BY p.project_id;
```
